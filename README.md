# Unity+Ink Game
I never finished this project. It was supposed to be a dialog-focused exploration game (see something like *An Airport For Aliens Currently Run By Dogs* for an example).

It uses Ink for its dialog capabilities, and has a Quake MAP file compiler and importer so I could use Trenchbroom to design levels.
I made the UI myself.
